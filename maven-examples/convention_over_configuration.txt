Standard directory layout of Maven
in our pom.xml we never mentioned where the main.java is located but still when we run maven, it finds the main.java class file and creates main.class
Instead of specifying the location of java source file we simply place the source files in the predefined location. This is called convention over configuration

We can change the standard layout directory by giving customized path in the pom.xml for source and target files

eg:
<build>
        <sourceDirectory>src/main/another-src</sourceDirectory> <!--new source directory with new java file named as Application-->
        <directory>myTarget</directory> <!--new target directory to store Application.Class file -->
    </build>
